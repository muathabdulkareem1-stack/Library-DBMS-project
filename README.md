# Library-DBMS-project
This project is a complete Library Management System built in C, designed to simulate how a simple database management system operates internally. Instead of relying on a traditional SQL database, the system uses dynamic data structures, indexing techniques, and file storage to manage books, members, library cards, and borrowing operations.
